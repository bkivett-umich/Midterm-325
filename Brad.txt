Hello, my name is Brad Kivett. I learned that I loved programming in the 9th grade when I took my first Computer Science class
at Grand Blanc High School. My major is Computer Science, but I plan on minoring in Cyber Security as it really interests me as well. Over the
weekend, I was the best man in a wedding! It was my first time ever being in a bridal party. :)

My youngest cat of four loves to sit on her siblings and fight when she's not getting her way. She is such a princess!
